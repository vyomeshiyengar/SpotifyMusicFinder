# SpotifyMusicFinder
 
 This was created using the Spotipy API, and used the json decoder to interpret the information provided from the Spotify server. 

 The program allows for an artist to be searched for, similar artists to be found, the artist's top tracks and most recent albums to be played. It also creates a playlist for any songs that are liked by the user.
